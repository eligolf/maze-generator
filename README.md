# Maze Generator
The code creates a maze by using a recursive backtracking algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm). It can be used for creating childrens mazes, mazes for games or any other place where you need a maze.

# Showcase
Here is a visual representation of the backtracking algorithm in action. The process is slowed down because I think it looks sort of fun when it creates the maze and then backtracks to the start again. 

# Why?
I wanted to try to create a maze generator mainly because it looks pretty cool. Then I thought it could be fun to implement in a version of my A* Pathfinding algorithm, so that the pathfinding algorithm could find its way through the maze.
